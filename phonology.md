CAPHI: CAMeL Arabic Phonetic Inventory
===

### Mission Statement
<details>

<summary>

   </summary>

  CAPHI is designed to provide a system for transcribing all sounds found in all the dialects of Arabic, including Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in a simple and objective way, but still maintaining enough complexity to distinguish meaningful differences between dialects.

### Goals
<details>

<summary> 
   </summary>

  1. Coverage - cover all known dialects
  2. Simplicity - ignore minor differences in sounds that only linguists are trained to notice
  3. Extensibility - CAPHI can be used to describe dialectal differences that have not been previously documented or studied
  4. Representation - The writing system is precise enough to facilitate the above goals without being unnecessarily complex
  5. Intuitive form - The CAPHI alphabet was designed to have an intuitive relationship between the letters and the sounds they stand for, making it easy to learn and use

### Explanation

   </summary>

The CAMeL Arabic Phonetic Inventory (CAPHI) is a system for representing, i.e. transcribing, the production of Arabic utterances in any dialect, from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to the regional colloquial varieties. CAPHI represents every significant sound in all Arabic dialects with a unique letter, meaning that it can be used to represent different pronunciations of words that would otherwise be spelled in the same way according to MSA, CODA, Arabizi, or other Arabic spelling standards. Furthermore, the one-to-one relationship between the letters of CAPHI and the sounds they represent means that there will never be uncertainty regarding how to spell a given utterance.
The sounds represented in CAPHI consist of all the sounds that can be used to distinguish meaning in any dialect as well as other sounds which are confusable with sounds that distinguish meaning. A sound distinguishes meaning if you can exchange it for another sound in some context and change the meaning of the word in question.
For Example:
1. Sounds that distinguish meaning: /q/, commonly represented as ق; and /k/, commonly represented as ك, are two sounds used to distinguish meaning because exchanging one for the other can change the meaning of a word, i.e. /q a l b/, قلب, “heart”; and /k a l b/,   كلب, “dog”. If a sound distinguishes meaning in any single dialect, we include it as a sound in CAPHI, even if it is not used by any other dialect to distinguish meaning.
2. Sounds that do not distinguish meaning but are included in CAPHI: any sound in one dialect which does not distinguish meaning but is confusable with a meaning-distinguishing sound of another dialect is included in CAPHI. Iraqi Arabic has an emphatic p-sound, /p./ as well as a regular p-sound, /p/. The second of which is the only one that is used to distinguish meaning, but by listening closely, one can identify certain environments that cause the speaker to pronounce /p./ instead of /p/. Because many other dialects do not have a /p/, but only a b-sound, /b/, the /p./ is often confused with /b/, which is the most similar sound in many dialects. Thus, /p./ is included in CAPHI as it is useful in describing the dialectal differences between Iraqi and other dialects.
3. Sounds that do not distinguish meaning and are not included in CAPHI: a sound will not be included in CAPHI if it does not distinguish meaning and is not confusable with any other sound that does. All known Arabic dialects have emphatic consonants which affect the pronunciation of surrounding vowels. Thus the emphatic ص, /s./ in صار, /s. aa r/, “he became” causes the word to be pronounced something like /s. aa. r/ with a long emphatic /a/. On the other hand, in the word سار, /s aa r/ “he marched” the pronunciation of the vowel is unaffected, /s aa r/. While the emphaticness of the consonant distinguishes meaning in these two words, the resulting emphaticness that is pronounced when uttering the /a/ sound in صار, /s. aa. r/ is never used to distinguish meaning. It is just the result of the position of the vocal tract being affected by the preceding consonant. Thus, /aa./ does not exist in the CAPHI alphabet and neither do any such emphatic vowels because they would never be confused with any meaning-distinguishing sound except for the very sound from which they were derived. That is to say that /aa./ would only ever be confused with /aa/ and /uu./ with /uu/, etc. so we do not ask users to make these distinctions in pronunciations which can be very difficult to detect. 
However, in some words an emphatic consonant will cause some of its non-adjacent neighbors, even consonants, to become emphatic (التفخيم بالمجاورة). For example, the words صوت and سوط are pronounced the same in MSA: /s. a w t./.  For such words, all emphasized consonants will be indicated regardless of the spelling of the word. For example the Levantine word فستان is pronounced /f u s. t. aa n/, despite being spelled without any emphatic consonants.
4. Foreign and Borrowed words: occasionally foreign words are borrowed but retain some foreign pronunciation features. For such words, we will force the CAPHI representation to be limited to the CAPHI phonological symbol set. A special symbol (~) will be added to mark that this is an approximation.    
    1. Examples:
        1. blanc (French 'white', IPA /blɑ̃/)  ==>  /~ b l o n/
        2. train (French 'train', IPA /trɛ̃/) ==> /~ t r a n/
        3. musée (French 'museum', IPA /myze/)  ==> /~ m y u z e/

### Guidelines for writing in CAPHI
<details>

<summary>

   </summary>

General Instructions:
* Memorize the CAPHI Phonetic Inventory (see bottom of this page) and refer back to it as often as necessary.  
* Separate all sounds and boundary markers with a space. 
Begin and end CAPHI representations with a “/” (no need to put a space before or after these slashes).
* Word boundaries can be represented with a “#” when necessary.
Be sure to describe the entire phrase as you would pronounce it naturally without thinking of orthographic boundaries, and only place the # marker afterwards.  
* Say the word or utterance out loud and try to imagine a natural situation in which you would say it.
* Pay attention to how an utterance is said and not to how it is written, keeping in mind that pronunciation can change depending on the context of the utterance.
